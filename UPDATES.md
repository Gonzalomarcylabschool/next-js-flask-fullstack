# Project Updates Log

This document outlines the changes made to the Next.js & Flask Full-Stack Template to integrate a PostgreSQL database and create a functional task management application. For each major change, I've detailed the specific modifications and the reasoning behind them.

## üöÄ Overview of Changes

The project was updated to transition from a simple in-memory data store to a robust PostgreSQL database. This involved significant modifications to the backend, the implementation of a functional user interface on the frontend, and the introduction of best practices for database management and security.

##  Backend (`server/`)

### 1. **Database Integration with PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy**
- **Why was this change made?** The original in-memory list was not a persistent data store, meaning all tasks were lost every time the server restarted. For a functional application, a real database is essential to ensure data is saved permanently. PostgreSQL was chosen as it is a powerful, open-source relational database, and SQLAlchemy Core was selected for its flexibility in managing database connections and executing queries efficiently.
- **What was changed?**
    - **Added `db.py`**: A new file was created to handle the database connection and to define the `tasks` table schema. Separating this logic makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
    - **Updated `app.py`**: The main Flask application was refactored to remove the in-memory list and use the new database connection for all API endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). This ensures all task operations are persistent.

### 2. **Environment Variable Management**
- **Why was this change made?** Hardcoding sensitive information like database credentials directly into the source code is a major security risk and makes the application inflexible. Using a `.env` file allows for secure and easy configuration for different environments (e.g., development vs. production) without changing the code.
- **What was changed?**
    - **Integrated `python-dotenv`**: The `python-dotenv` library was used to load environment variables from a `.env` file when the application starts.
    - **Updated `db.py`**: The database connection string is now securely read from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

## Frontend (`task-app-frontend/`)

### 1. **Functional Task Management UI**
- **Why was this change made?** The default Next.js starter page was only a placeholder. To make the project a useful template, a functional user interface was needed to allow users to interact with the backend API and manage tasks.
- **What was changed?**
    - **Refactored `src/app/page.tsx`**: The main page was completely rebuilt to create a user-friendly task management UI. It now includes a form for creating new tasks, a list for displaying them, and buttons for updating and deleting tasks. The interface is styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and clean design.

### 2. **API Integration**
- **Why was this change made?** The frontend and backend are separate applications, and they need a way to communicate. API integration allows the frontend to send and receive data from the backend, making it possible to create, view, update, and delete tasks from the user interface.
- **What was changed?**
    - **Added API Call Functions**: The frontend now includes functions to handle all the necessary API calls: `fetchTasks`, `handleSubmit` (for creating tasks), `handleDelete`, and `toggleComplete` (for updates).
    - **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks were used to manage the application's state, ensuring the UI stays in sync with the data in the database.

## üìù Next Steps

To run this updated application, you will need to:

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `server/` directory with your `DATABASE_URL`.
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname"
    ```
2.  **Run the database schema creation script**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    python db.py
    ```
3.  **Start the backend and frontend servers** as described in the main `README.md`.
